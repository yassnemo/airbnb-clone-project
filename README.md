- Practice team collaboration with defined roles and agile methodologies.
- Ensure best practices in code organization, version control, and testing.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React framework)
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
- **Design Tools**: Figma for UI/UX design

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Identifying design properties in a mockup, such as colors and typography, ensures consistency across the application. A well-defined design system streamlines development by providing clear guidelines for developers and designers, reduces visual inconsistencies, and enhances the user experience. It also helps maintain brand identity and ensures accessibility by selecting readable fonts and high-contrast colors.
